// Implement strStr().

// Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

// Clarification:

// What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

// For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

/**
 * @param {string} haystack
 * @param {string} needle
 * @return {number}
 */
 var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
    if (needle.length === 0){return 0}
     
     match = haystack.match(needle)
     return match?match.index:-1;
 };
